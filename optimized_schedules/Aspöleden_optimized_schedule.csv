Given the provided information, I'll provide an optimized schedule for the Aspöleden route. The optimized schedule will use only one ferry during late-night hours (10 PM–6 AM) and schedule trips every 50 minutes instead of 25 minutes during off-peak times. During peak hours, both ferries will be used to meet demand.

2. Fleet Assignments:
- Peak hours (6 AM–9 AM and 4 PM–7 PM): Yxlan and Aspö3
- Off-peak hours (9 AM–4 PM and 7 PM–6 AM): Yxlan

3. Feasibility Analysis:
The proposed changes are feasible as they take into consideration the demand during peak hours by utilizing both ferries. During off-peak hours, the frequency of trips is reduced, thus saving on fuel and reducing emissions. The use of only one ferry during late-night hours also contributes to reduced emissions.

4. Emissions and Demand:
The exact amount of emissions reduced would require specific fuel consumption and emission data for the ferries. However, by halving the frequency of trips during off-peak hours and using only one ferry during late-night hours, significant reductions in emissions can be expected. The demand is met by using both ferries during peak hours, ensuring that the service remains efficient and reliable for passengers.
