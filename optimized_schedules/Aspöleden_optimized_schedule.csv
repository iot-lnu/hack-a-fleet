Optimizing ferry operations involves a balance between meeting demand, reducing emissions, and minimizing underutilized trips. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Demand Forecasting**: Use historical data to predict peak and off-peak times. This will help you schedule ferries more efficiently, reducing unnecessary trips during low-demand periods and ensuring adequate service during high-demand periods.

2. **Fleet Allocation**: Allocate more ferries to routes with higher demand. For the Aspöleden route, consider using both ferries (Yxlan and Aspö3) during peak hours, and just one during off-peak hours.

3. **Fuel Efficiency**: Consider using more fuel-efficient ferries or even electric ferries if possible. This can significantly reduce emissions.

4. **Optimized Schedules**: Adjust ferry departure times to better match demand. For example, if demand is highest at the start and end of the workday, schedule more ferries during these times.

Given the information provided, here's an optimized schedule for the Aspöleden route:
