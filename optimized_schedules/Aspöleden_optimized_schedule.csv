Given the optimization goals and current fleet, we can propose the following:

1. Optimized Schedule (in CSV format):

```csv
Timestamp,Route,Ferry
00:30,Karlskrona_Aspö,Yxlan
01:20,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
02:10,Karlskrona_Aspö,Yxlan
03:00,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
03:50,Karlskrona_Aspö,Yxlan
04:40,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
05:30,Karlskrona_Aspö,Yxlan
06:00,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
06:30,Karlskrona_Aspö,Yxlan
07:00,Aspö_Karlskrona,Aspö3
07:30,Karlskrona_Aspö,Yxlan
08:00,Aspö_Karlskrona,Aspö3
08:30,Karlskrona_Aspö,Yxlan
09:00,Aspö_Karlskrona,Aspö3
09:30,Karlskrona_Aspö,Yxlan
10:00,Aspö_Karlskrona,Aspö3
10:30,Karlskrona_Aspö,Yxlan
11:00,Aspö_Karlskrona,Aspö3
```
This pattern continues until 22:00 when Aspö3 is taken out of service and Yxlan continues on the 50-minute schedule until 06:00 the next morning.

2. Adjusted Fleet Assignments:

- Off-peak hours (10 PM–6 AM): Only Yxlan operates.
- Peak hours (6 AM–10 PM): Both Yxlan and Aspö3 operate, alternating routes every 30 minutes.

3. Feasibility Analysis:

This proposed schedule ensures that demand is met during peak hours by utilizing both ferries. During off-peak hours, reducing service to a single ferry every 50 minutes should still meet reduced demand while also reducing emissions. It's important to monitor passenger numbers during these off-peak times to ensure that demand is still being met with the reduced service. 

This schedule also allows for regular maintenance of the ferries, as each has a period out of service each day. This can lead to increased longevity and reduced operating costs in the long term.

4. Detailed Schedule:

The detailed schedule is provided above in CSV format, with the pattern continuing until 22:00 when Aspö3 is taken out of service. This schedule ensures that there is a ferry departing every 30 minutes during peak hours, and every 50 minutes during off-peak hours. 

Please note that this is a proposed schedule and may need to be adjusted based on actual demand and other operational considerations. It is also recommended to have a contingency plan in case of any ferry breakdown or other unforeseen situations.
