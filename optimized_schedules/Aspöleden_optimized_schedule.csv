The task at hand is to optimize the ferry schedules and fleet usage for the Aspöleden route. 

1. Optimized Schedule:

The optimized schedule is as follows (CSV format):

Timestamp,Route,Ferry
00:30,Karlskrona_Aspö,Yxlan
01:20,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
02:10,Karlskrona_Aspö,Yxlan
03:00,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
03:50,Karlskrona_Aspö,Yxlan
04:40,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
05:30,Karlskrona_Aspö,Yxlan
06:00,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
06:30,Karlskrona_Aspö,Aspö3
07:00,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
07:30,Karlskrona_Aspö,Aspö3
08:00,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
08:30,Karlskrona_Aspö,Aspö3
09:00,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
09:30,Karlskrona_Aspö,Aspö3
10:20,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
11:10,Karlskrona_Aspö,Aspö3
12:00,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
12:50,Karlskrona_Aspö,Aspö3
13:40,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
14:30,Karlskrona_Aspö,Aspö3
15:20,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
16:10,Karlskrona_Aspö,Aspö3
17:00,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
17:30,Karlskrona_Aspö,Aspö3
18:00,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
18:30,Karlskrona_Aspö,Aspö3
19:20,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
20:10,Karlskrona_Aspö,Aspö3
21:00,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
21:50,Karlskrona_Aspö,Aspö3
22:40,Aspö_Karlskrona,Yxlan
23:30,Karlskrona_Aspö,Yxlan

2. Adjusted Fleet Assignments:

During off-peak hours (10 PM–6 AM), only the Yxlan ferry is in operation. During peak hours, both ferries (Yxlan and Aspö3) are in operation to meet the demand.

3. Feasibility Analysis:

The proposed changes are feasible as they ensure that demand is met during peak hours by utilizing both ferries. During off-peak hours, the frequency of trips is reduced, which would lead to reduced emissions. The schedule also ensures that there is a ferry available every 50 minutes instead of 25 minutes during off-peak times, which is more efficient and cost-effective.

4. Simulated Emissions and Demand:

By reducing the frequency of trips during off-peak hours and utilizing only one ferry, the emissions would be significantly reduced. This is due to less fuel consumption by the ferries. On the other hand, during peak hours, the demand is met by utilizing both ferries, ensuring that the service is efficient and reliable for the passengers.
