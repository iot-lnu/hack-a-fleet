Based on the provided information, there are several ways to optimize the ferry operations for the Ljusteröleden route. 

1. **Fleet Allocation Adjustments**: 

   We currently have two ferries operating on the Ljusteröleden route: Jupiter and Frida. If we want to reduce emissions, we might consider replacing one or both of these ferries with more energy-efficient models. Alternatively, we could consider retrofitting the existing ferries with cleaner engines or hybrid systems. 

2. **Optimized Schedules**: 

   The current schedule seems to have some inefficiencies, such as ferries leaving at the same time from opposite ends of the route. This could result in unmet demand during peak hours and underutilized trips during off-peak hours. 

   A better approach might be to stagger the departures so that a ferry is always on route. For instance, if the crossing time is 7 minutes, and we allow 3 minutes for loading and unloading, a single ferry could theoretically make the round trip in 20 minutes. With two ferries, we could have a departure every 10 minutes. 

   Here is an example of how this might look in CSV format:

   ```
   Timestamp,Route
   00:00,Ljusterö_Östanå
   00:10,Östanå_Ljusterö
   00:20,Ljusterö_Östanå
   00:30,Östanå_Ljusterö
   00:40,Ljusterö_Östanå
   00:50,Östanå_Ljusterö
   ...
   23:10,Ljusterö_Östanå
   23:20,Östanå_Ljusterö
   23:30,Ljusterö_Östanå
   23:40,Östanå_Ljusterö
   23:50,Ljusterö_Östanå
   ```

   During peak hours, we could further increase the frequency by having both ferries in operation. During off-peak hours, we could reduce the frequency to avoid underutilized trips.

3. **Demand Analysis and Adjustment**: 

   It's also important to analyze the demand for the ferry service throughout the day and adjust the schedule accordingly. For instance, if there's a high demand in the morning and evening (commute times
