Due to the complexity and specific nature of this task, a full optimization would require more detailed data, such as the number of passengers per crossing, capacity of the ferries, fuel consumption rates, and emission rates. However, based on the information provided, I can provide some general recommendations.

1. Optimized Schedule:

Given the current schedule and the goal to reduce emissions, we can propose an optimized schedule as follows:

```
Timestamp,Route,Ferry
00:00,Ljusterö_Östanå,Frida
00:10,Östanå_Ljusterö,Frida
01:00,Ljusterö_Östanå,Frida
01:10,Östanå_Ljusterö,Frida
02:00,Ljusterö_Östanå,Frida
02:10,Östanå_Ljusterö,Frida
03:10,Östanå_Ljusterö,Frida
04:00,Ljusterö_Östanå,Jupiter
04:10,Östanå_Ljusterö,Jupiter
05:00,Ljusterö_Östanå,Jupiter
```

This schedule suggests using Frida during the off-peak hours (midnight to 4 am) and switching to Jupiter during the peak hours (4 am onwards).

2. Adjusted Fleet Assignments:

- Peak Hours (Summer weekends and holidays): Jupiter and Frida
- Off-Peak Hours: Frida
- Winter weekdays: Jupiter

3. Feasibility Analysis:

The proposed changes seem feasible as they align with the optimization goals. Using only Jupiter during winter weekdays should significantly reduce emissions, while switching to Frida during off-peak times will minimize fuel usage. However, a more detailed analysis would require data on passenger demand, ferry capacity, fuel consumption, and emission rates.

4. Simulated Emissions and Demand:

Without specific data on the emission rates of the ferries and the passenger demand, it's not possible to provide a simulated amount of emissions decreased or whether the demand is being met. However, it's reasonable to expect a significant reduction in emissions by using only one ferry during winter weekdays and off-peak times. The demand should be met as long as the capacity of the ferries is sufficient for the number of passengers.
