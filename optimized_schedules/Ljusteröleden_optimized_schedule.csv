Given the information provided, we can start to construct a preliminary plan for optimizing the ferry schedules and fleet usage for the Ljusteröleden route.

1. Optimized Schedule:

The current schedule for the Ljusteröleden route seems to be running on a continuous hourly cycle, with a 10-minute gap between each ferry. Considering the crossing time is 7 minutes, this leaves a 53-minute gap of inactivity for each ferry, which could be optimized.

A possible optimized schedule could be as follows:

```
Timestamp,Route
00:00,Ljusterö_Östanå
00:15,Östanå_Ljusterö
00:30,Ljusterö_Östanå
00:45,Östanå_Ljusterö
01:00,Ljusterö_Östanå
01:15,Östanå_Ljusterö
01:30,Ljusterö_Östanå
01:45,Östanå_Ljusterö
...
```

This schedule would allow for a ferry to depart every 15 minutes, effectively quadrupling the number of crossings.

2. Adjusted Fleet Assignments:

During summer weekends and holidays, when demand is at its peak, both ferries (Jupiter and Frida) would be in operation, following the optimized schedule above.

During winter weekdays, only the Jupiter would be in operation, following the optimized schedule. This would reduce emissions, as per the optimization goals.

During off-peak times, the Frida would be in operation, following the optimized schedule. This would minimize fuel usage, as per the optimization goals.

3. Feasibility Analysis:

The proposed changes are likely to be feasible, as they would increase the number of crossings, thereby meeting demand more effectively. The use of only one ferry during winter weekdays would reduce emissions, and the use of the Frida during off-peak times would minimize fuel usage.

However, a more detailed analysis would need to be conducted to ensure that the increased frequency of crossings would not lead to undue wear and tear on the ferries, and that the increased workload would not lead to increased staff costs.

Also, it would be necessary to ensure that the increased frequency of crossings would not lead to congestion at the ferry terminals, and that the terminals would be able to handle the increased volume of traffic.

Finally, the proposed changes would need to be communicated effectively to the public, to ensure that they are aware of the new schedule and can plan their journeys accordingly.
