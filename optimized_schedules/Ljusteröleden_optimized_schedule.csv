To optimize the ferry schedules and fleet usage for the Ljusteröleden route, we first need to understand the current demand and capacity of the ferries, as well as the specific goals of the optimization.

1. Optimized Schedule:

Based on the current schedule, the ferries are operating every hour with a 10-minute gap between departures from the two ends of the route. To optimize this, we can consider reducing the frequency during off-peak hours and increasing it during peak hours. The following is an example of an optimized schedule:

```
Timestamp,Route
06:00,Ljusterö_Östanå
06:15,Östanå_Ljusterö
06:30,Ljusterö_Östanå
06:45,Östanå_Ljusterö
07:00,Ljusterö_Östanå
07:15,Östanå_Ljusterö
07:30,Ljusterö_Östanå
07:45,Östanå_Ljusterö
08:00,Ljusterö_Östanå
08:15,Östanå_Ljusterö
... (repeat every 15 minutes until 10:00)
10:00,Ljusterö_Östanå
11:00,Östanå_Ljusterö
12:00,Ljusterö_Östanå
13:00,Östanå_Ljusterö
14:00,Ljusterö_Östanå
15:00,Östanå_Ljusterö
... (repeat every hour until 16:00)
16:00,Ljusterö_Östanå
16:15,Östanå_Ljusterö
16:30,Ljusterö_Östanå
16:45,Östanå_Ljusterö
17:00,Ljusterö_Östanå
17:15,Östanå_Ljusterö
17:30,Ljusterö_Östanå
17:45,Östanå_Ljusterö
18:00,Ljusterö_Östanå
18:15,Östanå_Ljusterö
... (repeat every 15 minutes until 20:00)
20:00,Ljusterö_Östanå
21:00,Östanå_Ljusterö
22:00,Ljusterö_Östanå
23:00,Östanå_Ljusterö
```

2. Adjusted Fleet Assignments:

During peak hours (06:00-10:00 and 16:00-20:00), both Jupiter and Frida can be used to meet the high demand. During off-peak hours (10:00-16:00 and 20:00-06:00), only Frida can be used to minimize fuel usage.

3. Feasibility Analysis:

The proposed changes are likely to be feasible as they take into account the varying demand throughout the day. By using both ferries during peak hours, we can ensure that the demand is met. By using only Frida during off-peak hours, we can minimize fuel usage and reduce emissions.

4. Simulated Emissions and Demand:

Assuming that Jupiter has higher emissions and fuel usage than Frida, the proposed changes would result in a significant reduction in emissions. The exact amount would depend on the specific emission and fuel usage rates of the two ferries. As for demand, the increased frequency during peak hours should be sufficient to meet the higher demand during these times. During off-peak hours, the reduced frequency is likely to be sufficient to meet the lower demand.
