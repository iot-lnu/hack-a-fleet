1. Optimized Schedule (CSV format):

The optimized schedule will be based on the assumption that the ferry can return immediately after reaching the destination. Given that the crossing time is only 4 minutes, the ferries should be able to make a round trip in about 10 minutes, accounting for loading and unloading. 

```
Timestamp,Route,Ferry
00:00,Furusund_Yxlan,Merkurius
00:10,Yxlan_Furusund,Merkurius
00:20,Furusund_Yxlan,Merkurius
00:30,Yxlan_Furusund,Merkurius
...
23:30,Yxlan_Furusund,Merkurius
```
During summer holidays and weekends, Gulli will also operate:
```
Timestamp,Route,Ferry
00:05,Furusund_Yxlan,Gulli
00:15,Yxlan_Furusund,Gulli
00:25,Furusund_Yxlan,Gulli
00:35,Yxlan_Furusund,Gulli
...
23:35,Yxlan_Furusund,Gulli
```

2. Adjusted Fleet Assignments:

For winter weekdays, only Merkurius will operate. It will cover all trips throughout the day.

During summer holidays and weekends, both Merkurius and Gulli will operate. Merkurius will start at the hour, and Gulli will start 5 minutes after. This will ensure a ferry departs every 5 minutes.

For off-peak trips, Gulli will be used to reduce emissions. Off-peak hours can be defined as 10:00-16:00 on weekdays.

3. Feasibility Analysis:

This proposed schedule and fleet assignment should meet demand as it provides a consistent and frequent service. The use of Gulli during off-peak hours will help reduce emissions. However, this proposal assumes that there is sufficient demand for a ferry every 5 minutes during peak times and that the ferries can be loaded and unloaded quickly. These assumptions should be validated with data on passenger demand and operational efficiency.

4. Fully Optimized Detailed Schedule:

The fully optimized detailed schedule would require additional data on passenger demand at different times of day and week, as well as operational constraints such as maintenance schedules and crew availability. Once this data is available, a more detailed optimization can be performed.
