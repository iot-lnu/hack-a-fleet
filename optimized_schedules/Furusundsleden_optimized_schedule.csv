Given the lack of specific details about the fleet, such as their capacity, speed, fuel consumption, and emissions, and the demand for the route, I will make assumptions to provide a general optimization plan.

Assumptions:
1. Merkurius is a larger, faster but less fuel-efficient ferry.
2. Gulli is a smaller, slower but more fuel-efficient ferry.
3. Demand for the route is higher during peak hours (6:00-9:00 and 16:00-19:00) and on weekends and holidays.

Optimized Schedule (CSV format):
```
Timestamp,Route,Ferry
00:00,Furusund_Yxlan,Merkurius
00:00,Yxlan_Furusund,Merkurius
01:00,Furusund_Yxlan,Gulli
01:00,Yxlan_Furusund,Gulli
02:00,Furusund_Yxlan,Gulli
02:00,Yxlan_Furusund,Gulli
04:30,Furusund_Yxlan,Gulli
04:30,Yxlan_Furusund,Gulli
05:00,Furusund_Yxlan,Merkurius
05:00,Yxlan_Furusund,Merkurius
...
```
The schedule continues in this manner, with Merkurius operating during peak hours and Gulli during off-peak hours. On weekends and holidays, both ferries operate all day.

Fleet Assignments:
- Merkurius: Peak hours on weekdays, all hours on weekends and holidays.
- Gulli: Off-peak hours on weekdays.

Feasibility Analysis:
The proposed changes should be feasible given the assumptions. Using Gulli during off-peak hours should reduce emissions, while using Merkurius during peak hours and on weekends/holidays should ensure demand is met. The exact feasibility would need to be confirmed with more specific data.

Emissions and Demand:
Again, without specific data, it's difficult to quantify the reduction in emissions and the ability to meet demand. However, the general principle is that using a more fuel-efficient ferry during off-peak hours when demand is lower should reduce emissions. Meanwhile, using a larger, faster ferry during peak hours and on weekends/holidays should ensure that demand is met.
