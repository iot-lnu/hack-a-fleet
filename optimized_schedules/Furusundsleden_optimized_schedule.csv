Given the information provided, here is a proposed optimized schedule and fleet assignment for the Furusundsleden route. 

1. Optimized Schedule (CSV format):

```
Timestamp,Route,Ferry
00:00,Furusund_Yxlan,Merkurius
00:00,Yxlan_Furusund,Merkurius
01:00,Furusund_Yxlan,Merkurius
01:00,Yxlan_Furusund,Merkurius
02:00,Furusund_Yxlan,Merkurius
02:00,Yxlan_Furusund,Merkurius
04:30,Furusund_Yxlan,Gulli
04:30,Yxlan_Furusund,Gulli
05:00,Furusund_Yxlan,Gulli
05:00,Yxlan_Furusund,Gulli
```

2. Adjusted Fleet Assignments: 

During winter weekdays, only Merkurius will be operating. During summer holidays and weekends, both Merkurius and Gulli will be operating. Gulli will be used for off-peak trips to reduce emissions.

3. Feasibility Analysis:

This proposed schedule and fleet assignment should be feasible given the current demand and the desire to reduce emissions. By using only one ferry during winter weekdays, we can reduce unnecessary ferry operations and thus reduce emissions. Furthermore, by using Gulli during off-peak hours, we can further reduce emissions as Gulli is presumably more fuel-efficient or uses a cleaner source of energy. 

4. Simulated Emissions and Demand:

Without specific data on the emission levels of each ferry and the exact demand levels, it's difficult to provide a simulated amount of emissions decreased and demand being met. However, it can be extrapolated that emissions will be reduced by cutting down on unnecessary ferry operations and by using a more fuel-efficient ferry during off-peak hours. As for demand, as long as the demand does not exceed the capacity of the ferries, it should be met under this new schedule and fleet assignment. 

Please note that the above proposal is based on the assumption that Gulli is more fuel-efficient or uses a cleaner source of energy than Merkurius. If this is not the case, the proposal would need to be adjusted accordingly. Also, it's important to consider other factors such as the maintenance schedule of the ferries, the weather conditions, and the potential increase in demand during holidays and weekends.
