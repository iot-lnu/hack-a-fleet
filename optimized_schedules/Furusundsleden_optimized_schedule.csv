Optimization Plan:

The optimization of the Furusundsleden route will focus on the following key points:
1. Matching demand with supply: This will involve adjusting the schedule and fleet allocation to ensure that the number of ferries and their frequency matches the demand at different times of the day. 
2. Reducing emissions: This can be achieved by minimizing underutilized trips and considering the use of more environmentally friendly ferry options, such as electric or hybrid ferries.

Optimized Schedule:

Given the short crossing time of 4 minutes and the current schedule which offers a crossing every 30 minutes, it seems that the schedule is already quite efficient. However, without specific data on demand at different times of the day, it's difficult to optimize the schedule further. One suggestion could be to reduce the frequency of crossings during off-peak hours (e.g., late at night) to reduce emissions and operating costs. 

Fleet Allocation Adjustments:

Currently, there are two ferries operating on the Furusundsleden route: Merkurius and Gulli. To reduce emissions, one option could be to replace these with more environmentally friendly alternatives. Electric ferries, for example, produce zero emissions and are increasingly being used in ferry operations worldwide. Another option could be hybrid ferries, which use a combination of diesel and electric power and produce fewer emissions than traditional diesel ferries. 

It's also worth considering the size and capacity of the ferries. If demand is consistently high, larger ferries may be more efficient as they can carry more passengers per trip. Conversely, if demand is low, smaller ferries may be more efficient as they use less fuel.

Without specific data on the current fleet and demand levels, it's difficult to make more detailed recommendations. However, the principles outlined above should provide a good starting point for optimizing the Furusundsleden ferry operations.
