To optimize the ferry schedule and fleet usage for the Furusundsleden route, we need to consider the following factors:

- The crossing time for the Furusundsleden route is 4 minutes.
- Currently, two ferries are scheduled to operate simultaneously during the summer holidays and weekends.
- The goal is to use only Merkurius during winter weekdays, and use Gulli for off-peak trips to reduce emissions.

Given these constraints, I propose the following schedule and fleet assignments:

Optimized Schedule (CSV format snippet):

Timestamp,Route,Ferry
00:00,Furusund_Yxlan,Merkurius
00:04,Yxlan_Furusund,Merkurius
01:00,Furusund_Yxlan,Merkurius
01:04,Yxlan_Furusund,Merkurius
02:00,Furusund_Yxlan,Merkurius
02:04,Yxlan_Furusund,Merkurius
04:30,Furusund_Yxlan,Gulli (off-peak)
04:34,Yxlan_Furusund,Gulli (off-peak)
05:00,Furusund_Yxlan,Gulli (off-peak)
05:04,Yxlan_Furusund,Gulli (off-peak)

Adjusted Fleet Assignments:

- Peak hours (morning and evening): Merkurius and Gulli during summer holidays and weekends.
- Off-peak hours: Gulli only to reduce emissions.

Feasibility Analysis:

- The proposed changes are feasible given that the crossing time is only 4 minutes, which allows for a high frequency of trips. 
- Using only Merkurius during winter weekdays will reduce operational costs while still meeting demand as the traffic is expected to be lower during this period.
- Operating Gulli during off-peak hours will help in reducing emissions as it's presumed to be a more eco-friendly vessel.

Simulated Emission Reduction and Demand Met:

- The exact amount of emissions reduced will depend on the specific emission factors of the two ferries, which are not provided. However, it can be assumed that the emissions will be significantly reduced by using only one ferry during winter weekdays and using the more eco-friendly Gulli during off-peak hours.
- The demand is expected to be met given the high frequency of trips. The schedule can be adjusted based on real-time demand data to ensure optimal fleet usage and schedule optimization.
