Given the provided data, the main task at hand is to optimize the schedule for the Oxdjupsleden route, which operates between Rindö and Stenslätten on Värmdö in the Stockholm archipelago. 

1. Optimized Schedule:

The current schedule for the Oxdjupsleden route is not provided. However, based on the optimization goals, we can propose the following schedule in CSV format:

```
Timestamp,Route
00:00,Rindö_Värmdö
00:15,Rindö_Värmdö
00:30,Rindö_Värmdö
00:45,Rindö_Värmdö
01:00,Rindö_Värmdö
...
05:45,Rindö_Värmdö
06:00,Rindö_Värmdö
```

This schedule continues the same pattern every 15 minutes from 10 PM to 6 AM, reducing frequency to meet the optimization goals.

2. Adjusted Fleet Assignments:

Since the goal is to retain the Fragancia for all operations to minimize emissions, the fleet assignment for peak and off-peak hours would remain the same. The Fragancia would operate on the Oxdjupsleden route for all hours.

3. Feasibility Analysis:

The proposed changes seem feasible given the short crossing time (3 minutes) of the Oxdjupsleden route. This allows for a turnaround time of 12 minutes, which should be sufficient for loading and unloading passengers and vehicles. 

However, the actual feasibility would depend on factors like the actual demand during late-night hours, the capacity of the Fragancia, and the operational efficiency at the terminals. 

4. Simulated Emissions and Demand:

Without data on the current emissions and demand, it's impossible to accurately simulate the amount of emissions decreased and demand being met. However, generally speaking, running the ferry less frequently during late-night hours (when demand is usually lower) should reduce overall emissions. 

The demand being met would depend on the actual passenger and vehicle traffic during these hours. If the demand is higher than the capacity of the Fragancia running every 15 minutes, additional measures might be needed, such as running additional ferries during peak hours.
