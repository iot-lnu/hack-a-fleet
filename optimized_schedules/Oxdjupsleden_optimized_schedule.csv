Creating an optimized schedule and fleet assignment involves several considerations. For the Oxdjupsleden route, the ferry Fragancia has a crossing time of 3 minutes for a 500-meter route. Given the optimization goals, a new schedule for late-night hours (10 PM–6 AM) with a frequency of every 15 minutes can be proposed. 

However, without specific data on passenger demand during these hours, it's difficult to provide a fully optimized detailed schedule. Assuming the demand is low during these hours, the new schedule could look something like this:

```CSV
Timestamp,Route
22:00,Rindö_Värmdö
22:15,Rindö_Värmdö
22:30,Rindö_Värmdö
22:45,Rindö_Värmdö
23:00,Rindö_Värmdö
...
05:45,Rindö_Värmdö
06:00,Rindö_Värmdö
```

This schedule repeats every 15 minutes from 10 PM to 6 AM. During the day, the schedule could remain as it currently is or be optimized based on demand data.

For the fleet assignments, retaining Fragancia for all operations helps to minimize emissions. During peak hours, if the demand is high, consider operating Fragancia at full capacity. During off-peak hours, operate Fragancia at a reduced capacity to save energy.

The feasibility of these proposed changes depends on several factors:

1. **Demand:** The new schedule should meet the demand during late-night hours. If the demand is significantly higher or lower than expected, adjustments may be needed.

2. **Emissions:** Using Fragancia for all operations should reduce emissions, but this depends on the ferry's fuel efficiency and the total operating hours.

3. **Operational costs:** Reducing the frequency during late-night hours might save on operational costs, but this also depends on the costs of running Fragancia and the revenue from passengers.

4. **Service quality:** The changes should not significantly impact the service quality. If the ferry is overcrowded during peak hours or if passengers have to wait too long during off-peak hours, further optimizations might be necessary.

Without specific data, it's hard to make a detailed analysis. However, the proposed changes should provide a good starting point for optimizing the ferry schedule and fleet usage on the Oxdjupsleden route.
