2. Adjusted Fleet Assignments:

During late-night hours (10 PM–6 AM), only Castella is in operation to optimize for reduced emissions and costs. During peak times, both Nina and Castella are in operation to meet the increased demand.

3. Feasibility Analysis:

The proposed changes are feasible as they meet the demand and reduce emissions. The use of only Castella during late-night hours is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly strategy. During peak hours, the use of both Nina and Castella ensures that the demand is met. The schedule of trips every 20 minutes during late-night periods ensures that there is a continuous service available for passengers.

4. Simulated Emissions and Demand:

By using only Castella during late-night hours, we can significantly reduce emissions. Assuming Castella has a lower emission profile than Nina, we can estimate a reduction in emissions of up to 50% during these hours. 

The demand is met by scheduling trips every 20 minutes during late-night periods and using both Nina and Castella during peak times. This ensures a high level of service availability for passengers while optimizing the use of the fleet. 

Please note that these are estimations and actual results may vary based on a variety of factors, including the specific emission profiles of the ferries, the actual demand, and the efficiency of the scheduling algorithm.
