Optimization Plan:

1. Assign only the ferry Castella during late-night hours (10 PM–6 AM). This will help reduce costs and emissions during the period with the least demand.

2. Schedule trips every 20 minutes during late-night periods. This will ensure that there is still a reliable service for any passengers travelling at these times.

3. Use both Nina and Castella during peak times to meet demand. This will ensure that there is enough capacity to handle the increased number of passengers during these times.

4. The feasibility of these changes will be analyzed by comparing the new schedule and fleet assignments with the current ones. This will involve calculating the expected decrease in emissions and the expected increase in demand met.

5. The simulated amount of emissions decreased and demand being met will be calculated based on the new schedule and fleet assignments.

Adjusted Fleet Assignments:

Peak Hours (6 AM–10 PM): Nina and Castella
Off-Peak Hours (10 PM–6 AM): Castella

Feasibility Analysis:

The proposed changes are expected to be feasible as they will provide a reliable service for passengers while reducing costs and emissions. The use of only one ferry during off-peak hours will reduce emissions and costs, while the use of two ferries during peak hours will ensure that demand is met.

Simulated Emissions and Demand:

The simulated amount of emissions decreased will depend on the specific emissions of the Nina and Castella ferries. However, it can be expected that the emissions will decrease significantly during off-peak hours due to the use of only one ferry.

The demand being met will also depend on the specific capacity of the Nina and Castella ferries. However, it can be expected that the demand will be met during peak hours due to the use of two ferries. The demand during off-peak hours will be met by the regular service provided by the Castella ferry.
