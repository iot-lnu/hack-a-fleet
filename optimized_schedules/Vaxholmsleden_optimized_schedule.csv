Optimizing ferry operations for the Vaxholmsleden route would involve several steps. Here are some recommendations:

1. **Use energy-efficient ferries**: To reduce emissions, consider using energy-efficient or hybrid ferries. These types of ferries use less fuel and produce fewer emissions compared to traditional ferries.

2. **Optimize ferry schedules**: To meet demand efficiently and avoid unmet demand during peak hours, the ferry schedules should be optimized based on passenger demand. 

   - During peak hours, ensure that both ferries are in operation and increase the frequency of trips to accommodate more passengers.
   - During off-peak hours, reduce the frequency of trips or use only one ferry to minimize underutilized trips.
   - Ensure that the ferry schedule aligns with the schedules of other modes of transportation to provide seamless travel for passengers.

3. **Implement a dynamic pricing model**: To further optimize operations, consider implementing a dynamic pricing model where fares are higher during peak hours and lower during off-peak hours. This can help manage demand and ensure that ferries are not underutilized.

Here is an example of an optimized schedule for the Vaxholmsleden route:
