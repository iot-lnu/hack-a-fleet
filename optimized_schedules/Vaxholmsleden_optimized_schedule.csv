1. Optimized Schedule:

The schedule optimization aims to maintain service frequency while reducing fuel consumption and emissions. The proposed schedule for Vaxholmsleden is as follows (CSV format):

Timestamp, Route, Ferry
00:00, Vaxholm_Rindö, Castella
00:20, Vaxholm_Rindö, Castella
00:40, Vaxholm_Rindö, Castella
01:00, Vaxholm_Rindö, Castella
01:20, Vaxholm_Rindö, Castella
01:40, Vaxholm_Rindö, Castella
02:00, Vaxholm_Rindö, Castella
02:20, Vaxholm_Rindö, Castella
02:40, Vaxholm_Rindö, Castella
03:00, Vaxholm_Rindö, Castella
...
20:00, Vaxholm_Rindö, Nina
20:00, Vaxholm_Rindö, Castella
20:20, Vaxholm_Rindö, Nina
20:20, Vaxholm_Rindö, Castella
20:40, Vaxholm_Rindö, Nina
20:40, Vaxholm_Rindö, Castella

2. Fleet Assignments:

- Peak hours (6 AM–10 PM): Nina and Castella
- Off-peak hours (10 PM–6 AM): Castella only

3. Feasibility Analysis:

The proposed schedule and fleet assignments are feasible considering the ferry line length and crossing times. The use of two ferries during peak hours will ensure that demand is met. The use of only one ferry (Castella) during off-peak hours will contribute to reduced emissions. However, it is essential to monitor passenger demand during these hours to ensure service quality.

4. Simulated Emissions and Demand:

Assuming that the Nina and Castella are similar in terms of fuel consumption and emissions, the proposed schedule would result in a reduction of approximately 50% in emissions during off-peak hours (10 PM–6 AM). This is due to the use of only one ferry during these hours.

The demand during peak hours is expected to be met with the use of two ferries. During off-peak hours, the demand is typically lower, and the use of one ferry should be sufficient. However, this should be confirmed with passenger data.

Please note that these are estimations and actual results may vary based on factors such as weather conditions, ferry load, and other operational variables.
